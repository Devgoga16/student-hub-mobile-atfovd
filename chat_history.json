Successful login will navigate the user to the main app interface.\n-   **Main App Interface:** This will consist of a bottom navigation bar or drawer menu for easy access to different sections. The sections include: Dashboard, Personal Data, Curriculum, My Courses, Enrollment, and Schedules. Each section will initially display a placeholder screen with the corresponding title.\n-   **Navigation:** Implement seamless navigation between the login screen and the main app, as well as between the different sections within the main app.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n-   **Colors:**\n    -   Base color: Light gray or off-white for the background.\n    -   Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    -   Accent colors: A professional blue or green for buttons and highlights.\n    -   Highlight shades: Lighter shades of the accent color for interactive elements.\n-   **Typography:**\n    -   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default for each platform) or \"Roboto\" for Android and \"San Francisco\" for iOS.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Create Login Screen:** Implement a login screen with username and password input fields and a button.\n2.  **Implement Navigation:** Set up navigation using Expo Router to switch between the Login screen and the main app interface after successful login.\n3.  **Create Main App Sections:** Create placeholder screens for Dashboard, Personal Data, Curriculum, My Courses, Enrollment, and Schedules.\n4.  **Implement Bottom Navigation:** Implement a bottom navigation bar to allow users to easily switch between the main app sections.\n5.  **Add Header:** Include a header with the system name \"Student System\" on each screen.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-30T15:13:33.827971"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a modern Student System mobile application with React Native and Expo.

I've successfully added notification testing functionality to your Student System app. Here's what I implemented:\n\n## What I Added:\n\n### 1. **Notification Service** (`utils/notificationService.ts`)\n- **Permission handling**: Automatically requests notification permissions\n- **Multiple notification types**: Basic, scheduled, class reminders, and assignment reminders\n- **Platform-specific configuration**: Handles Android notification channels\n- **Error handling**: Comprehensive logging and error management\n\n### 2. **Dashboard Integration** \n- **New \"Notification Testing\" section**: Added between Quick Actions and Announcements\n- **Four test buttons**:\n  - **Test Basic**: Sends an immediate test notification\n  - **Scheduled (5s)**: Sends a notification after 5 seconds\n  - **Class Reminder**: Sends a sample class reminder notification\n  - **Assignment Due**: Sends a sample assignment due notification\n\n### 3. **Features**:\n- **Visual feedback**: Alert dialogs confirm when notifications are sent\n- **Loading states**: Button shows \"Sending...\" during processing\n- **Color-coded buttons**: Different colors for different notification types\n- **Icons**: Each button has a relevant icon (bell, clock, graduation cap, document)\n\n## How to Test:\n\n1. **Basic Test**: Tap \"Test Basic\" to send an immediate notification\n2. **Scheduled Test**: Tap \"Scheduled (5s)\" and wait 5 seconds for the notification\n3. **Class Reminder**: Tap \"Class Reminder\" to see a sample class notification\n4. **Assignment Due**: Tap \"Assignment Due\" to see a sample assignment notification\n\n## Key Features:\n\n- **Permission Management**: Automatically requests and handles notification permissions\n- **Cross-Platform**: Works on both iOS and Android with platform-specific optimizations\n- **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback and intuitive interface\n- **Extensible**: Easy to add more notification types in the future\n\nThe notification testing section is now integrated into your dashboard and ready to use! The app will request notification permissions when you first try to send a notification, and all test notifications include relevant data for future handling."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-30T15:37:30Z"}]
